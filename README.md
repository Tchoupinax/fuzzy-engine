### FAQ

#### How it works ?

You set your credentials with the form on the home page. Then, they are kept in a cookie. Not elsewhere. These credentials are used to request your registry. You can set your credentials from environment variables. When a credential is setted from environment, it could not be rewrited by user. Each credential is independant.

#### Why this is not an SPA ?

The docker registy [image](https://hub.docker.com/_/registry) does not allow cross-origin request, so browser prevents from making the requests. The only solution is to make requests backend side.
